# University of Arizona Librea Project

The University of Arizona Librea Project looks to improve the Earth's Radiation Budget by working with MODTRAN6 radiation transfer model and comparing the results with surface and CERES measurements. Our group work with the [Libera Team](https://lasp.colorado.edu/home/libera/) to understand surface and TOA fluxes. Eventually, we plan to work with the NASA satellite Librea which is scheduled for lauch in 2026.

# Highlights


Currently our team is still in the intial phases of our project. We have ran the MODTRAN6 radiative transfer model for a signal month.
We are comparing the results with multiple surface stations as well as CERES mesurments.
