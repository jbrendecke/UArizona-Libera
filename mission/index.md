Climate is controlled by the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth and the amount of infrared energy emitted to space. 
Understanding how light interacts with the atmosphere and land surfaces is critical in being able to accurately model the Earth system. 
Our group works with the MODTRAN6 radiation transfer model to better shortwave radiation fluxes at TOA and surface. 
While our work is important it is only one part of the Libera project. 
By working together with our research groups around the country we hope to better understand Earth's radiation budget and constrain future predictions for a warming planet.
