Climate is controlled by the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth and the amount of infrared energy emitted to space. 
Understanding how light interacts with the atmosphere and land surfaces is critical in being able to accurately model the Earth system. 
Our group works with the MODTRAN6 radiation transfer model to better shortwave radiation fluxes at TOA and surface. 
While our work is important it is only one part of the Libera project. 
By working together with our research groups around the country we hope to better understand Earth's radiation budget and constrain future predictions for a warming planet.

## Background

{% include section.html %}

 One of the greatest challenges in predicting how much the Earth will warm in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 involves the representation of clouds and their interactions with ERB in climate models. CERES data products have been developed specifically to meet this challenge by providing a comprehensive suite of variables that describe clouds and their influence on ERB. ![](https://lasp.colorado.edu/home/libera/files/2021/02/Libera.jpg) 
This is possible because the CERES data products take advantage of the synergy between collocated CERES instruments and imagers like MODIS (Terra and Aqua) and VIIRS (S-NPP, NOAA-20). Information about the diurnal cycle of clouds and radiation rely on geostationary imager data. (For more information about CERES data fusion, click on the “Instruments” link.
